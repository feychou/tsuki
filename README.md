# Facebook Example

A Facebook Messenger Bot Example in Clojure

### Facebook and app setup

1. Setup a Facebook Page, Facebook app, create a Page Access Token and link the app to the page by following this [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/prometheus-ai/fb-messenger-clj/wiki/Facebook-Setup).

2. Download the repository: [lemmings-io/02-facebook-example](https://github.com/lemmings-io/02-facebook-example/archive/master.zip)

3. Extract it into the `/lemmings/clojure/projects` directory.

4. Provide your Facebook Page Access Token, Verify Token and Page Secret for local development by creating a file called `profiles.clj` in your working directory `<your-project-name>/profiles.clj`

		{:dev {:env {:page-access-token "<REPLACE>"
		   		   	 :verify-token "<REPLACE>"}}}
		   		   	 
### Starting the development environment

1. Start a new VM shell session via `vagrant ssh` in your terminal.

2. Once logged in to the VM shell change into the facebook-example project directory

		cd 02-facebook-example/

3. Run `ngrok http 3000` ([read more about ngrok](https://ngrok.com))

4. Start another new VM shell session via `vagrant ssh` in a new terminal window.

5. Start the local server

		lein ring server-headless

	![Lein Server](resources/doc/images/lein-ring-server.png)
	
	Via the [lein-ring doc](https://github.com/weavejester/lein-ring): by default, this command attempts to find a free port, starting at 3000.

### Check if the app is running

1. Visit the https URL of the ngrok process you've started earlier in this guide.  
	E.g. `https://0db8caac.ngrok.io`
	
	If everything went right, you'll see "Hello Lemming :)" in your Browser üéà

2. In your Facebook Developer App go to "Webhooks" in the left sidebar and add `Callback URL` and `Verify Token` accordingly:

3. Click "Verify and Save" and your app is connected to Facebook's Messenger API. üéà

4. Go to your Facebook Page and send a message and your bot echo's your input. Congratulations!üíß

### Deploying to Heroku

1. If you haven't yet, create an account at [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/dc).

2. In the VM shell session login to your Heroku account via `heroku login`.

	```
	-> heroku login
	Enter your Heroku credentials.
	Email:
	Password:
	```

3. Create an app on Heroku for your bot. Type `heroku create` into your command prompt at the root of the project.

	```
	-> heroku create
	Creating gentle-plateau-38046... done, stack is cedar-14
	https://gentle-plateau-38046.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/gentle-plateau-38046.git
	Git remote heroku added
	```

4. Do a command line `heroku config` for each one of your tokens:

	```
	heroku config:set PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_page_access_token
	heroku config:set VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token
	```

5. In case you made any changes in your code after downloading the original repository you need to commit them with `git add .` in your command prompt to check-in your changes to Git Version Control and add a commit message with `git commit -m "updated my bot"`.

	**Keep in mind to repeat this step with every future code change to be able to push them to Heroku in the next step.**

	Hint: Check out the Links section at the bottom of this tutorial for more information around GitHub & Git Version Control.

7. Eventually, you can push all changes to Heroku with:

	`git push heroku master`

	You should see it deploy. üçµ

8. Now we need to setup your app on Facebook with your app hosted on Heroku.

	As you've done it earlier for your local environment, in your Facebook Developer App click on the "Webhooks" section in the left sidebar and add `Callback URL` (e.g. `https://gentle-plateau-38046.herokuapp.com/webhook`) and `Verify Token` accordingly.
	
	![Heroku Webhook Setup](resources/doc/images/heroku-webhook-setup.png)

9. Click "Verify and Save" and your Heroku app is connected to Facebook's Messenger API üéà

	![Heroku Webhook Success](resources/doc/images/heroku-webhook-success.png)
	
10. Go to your Facebook Page and send a message and your bot should echo your input again. Kudos! üôÇüíß

Note: This clojure app is ready for deployment on Heroku and based on [Heroku's Clojure Getting Started Example](https://github.com/heroku/clojure-getting-started).
